# Uptimer
 Python network tool for outage detection

## Why?
 I want a tangible, visual representation of how often my connection goes out every day (thank you AT&T). Works for any connection, and will yield a CSV file as a log.
 
## Usage
 Simply run
 `python tray.pyw`
 or open it as you would any executable
  
## TODO
 charting of outage occurrence/duration, optional mailer.
 
 Fix accuracy of downtime. It is currently *very* unreliable and I would not use it as a metric.
 
## Dependencies
 PyQt5, schedule, socket, win10Ttoast
